# TapIn

Tap In is an app designed to digitize the bar-patron interraction. Right now, if someone wishes to keep a tab open at a bar, 
they must leave their credit with the bar until they have saddled up. With this app, no physical exchange will be necessary.
Instead, the user will be able to 'Tap In' to the bar, giving the bar access to their credit card, and allowing them to 
add drinks to your tab. Each time a drink is added, the user will be notified in real-time, and accept/decline the charge. When
the user wishes to 'Tap Out' of the bar, the card will be charged, and both the consumer and merchant will have completed 
the transaction without any risk to either of losing the card or getting stiffed.
